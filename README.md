# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction System

A **Machine Learning-based Web Application** that predicts whether a person is diabetic or not based on their health details such as glucose level, BMI, insulin, and age.  
This project is built using **Flask**, **Python**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and a trained **ML model**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- User-friendly web interface for prediction  
- Predicts diabetes based on medical parameters  
- Built with Flask (Python) backend  
- Machine learning model trained on **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**  
- Real-time prediction using form inputs
